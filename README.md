# kepler-exoplanet-data-analysis
Data science notebook with analysis of ~10,000 objects found by the Kepler Space Telescope. A work in progress.

I'll continue to update this as I make more progress, you can see the latest version on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kirktobridge/analyzing-nasa-s-kepler-exoplanet-search-results/). As there is no Kaggle-to-GitHub tool, it's a bit tedious to update this page every time I commit something on Kaggle, so updates here will be intermittent.
